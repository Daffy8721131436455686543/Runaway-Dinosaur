                                <p>Once there was a little dinosaur called a Maiasaur, who lived with her mother.One day, she told her mother, “I wish I were special like the other dinosaurs. If I were a T.Rex, I could chomp with my ferocious teeth!”“But if you were a T.Rex,” said her mother, “how would you hug me with your tiny little arms?”“I wish I were an Apatosaurus,” said the little dinosaur, “so with my long neck I could see above the treetops.”“But if you were an Apatosaurus,” said her mother, “how would you hear me in the treetops when I told you I love you?”

“What makes you so special, little Maiasaur?” said her mother. “Is it your ferocious teeth or long neck or pointy beak? What makes you special is out of all the different dinosaurs in the big, wide world, you have the mother who is just right for you, and will always..</p>

    	<h4>Credit: I was watching an episode of CW’s The Flash and there was a scene when Barry and his mom talked about his favorite book from childhood “The Runaway Dinosaur”. I quite liked it and searched for it after the show ended, wanting to get one for my daughter. Turned out that it is not a real book, so I put together this based on the show transcript with slight modifications.</h4>
